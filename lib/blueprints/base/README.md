# Base Blueprint

This is the base project configuration

## Usage

To start developing, run `npm run start:dev`. This will kick off the development environment with HMR and doesn't use Server-side Rendering.

For production, run `npm run build` in order to build out the `static` folder with all of the fingerprinted assets. You can then start the production server using `npm start:prod`
